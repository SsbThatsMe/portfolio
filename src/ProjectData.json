A mixed reality method of Loci application was developed where objects could be represented either in 2D or 3D. Using this application, a between-subject test with 20 participants was performed to test if there was any difference in memory retention between the two modalities.",

We wanted to make a game with a novel input method, and decided to use a real skateboard to simulate what it would be like to drive a hoverboard. I mostly worked with the physics of the board, 3D modelling assets and building the environment.",
